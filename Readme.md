# Card Trick

Popularized by YouTuber [standupmaths](https://youtu.be/l7lP9y7Bb5g).  
Information theory tells us that in order to locate a card in a standard deck of 27 playing cards, 3 ternary-digits of information are sufficient (with some help from a well-defined process).  

This can be generalized for various bases, so long as you have enough unique cards. For instance, with 2 septenary-digits of information one can correctly identify a single card from a deck of 49. [Demonstrated again by Matt Parker](https://youtu.be/G_OuIVOGDr8)
