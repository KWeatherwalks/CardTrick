# Card Trick

Popularized by YouTuber [standupmaths](https://youtu.be/l7lP9y7Bb5g).  
By leveraging a bit of information theory (to locate a card in a deck of 27, 3 ternary-digits of information are all that is needed)  
This can be generalized for various bases, so long as you have enough unique cards. For instance, with 2 bits of information one can correctly identify a single card from a deck of 49. [Demonstrated again by Matt Parker](https://youtu.be/G_OuIVOGDr8)
